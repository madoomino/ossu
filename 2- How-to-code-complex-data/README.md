# This is the second course in the core programming part (how to code part 2).

## What I gained (Mindset)
- The importance of code design and architecture. I learned that it's not enough to just write code that works. I also need to think about the overall architecture of my code and how the different parts fit together. This makes my code more maintainable and easier to debug.
- How to think in an abstract and general way. I learned that it's important to be able to think about problems in a general way, rather than just focusing on the specific details. This allows me to come up with more elegant and efficient solutions.
- The importance of documentation. I learned that it's important to document my thought process, as well as the specific steps involved in my solutions to be able to go back and think about the overall picture.
- The ability to adapt to new ways of thinking.
- Thinking about a better approach even after implementing a solution. This includes looking for better ways to solve problems, as well as ways to make my code more efficient and elegant.
- The idea of code as functional parts combined together. "It's not a bunch of characters." said the instructor. It's a collection of functional 
parts that work together to solve a problem. This way of thinking about code helps me to write more modular and reusable code.

## What I gained (Technically)
- Mutual referential recursive functions. I learned how to write recursive functions that call each other. This is a powerful technique that can be used to solve some very difficult problems.
- Local scope explained in detail (not a fast explanation like most js courses).
- Abstract functions and templates. I learned about how to use abstract functions and templates. These are powerful tools that can be used to write more generic and reusable code.
- Generative recursion. This is a powerful technique that can be used to generate different kinds of data structures (gives me the ability to generate beautiful shapes :).
- Operating on complicated multi-dimensional lists. This is a challenging task, but it's important for understanding how to work with large amounts of data.
- Working with different types of accumulators. I learned about the different types of accumulators. This is important for understanding how to accumulate data in different ways, and keeping the context preserved.
- Operating on GRAPHS. I learned about the basics of graph theory and how to operate on graphs. This is a challenging topic, but it's important for understanding how to solve some very difficult problems (Wasn't fun ... maybe it was :).


## Conclusion
This course was by far the hardest experience I've had since starting to learn programming. But it was also the best one! The second part was shorter, yet x10 harder :"). Overall, the experience was useful and joyful. It actually expanded my horizons (IK I said it before :).
