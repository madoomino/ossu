# This is the second course in the core programming part (how to code part 2).

## What I gained (Mindset):
- A crucial point is the necessity of code design and code architecture; at some point near the end of the course
it was crystal clear that designing 
- Thinking in an abstract and general method.
- Thinking about the whole architecture before implementing any solutions.
- Documenting every step of the thinking process to make it easy to criticize it.
- Adapting to new methods of thinking.
- Thinking about a better approach even after implementing a solution.
- Thinking about code as functional parts combined together, "It's not a bunch of characters" said the instructor.

## What I gained (Technically):
- Mutual referential recursive functions (2 recursive functions call each other).
- Local scope explained in a detailed manner (not a fast explanation like js courses).
- Abstract functions and templates.
- Generative recursion (beautiful).
- Operating on complicated multi-dimensional lists.
- Working with different types of accumulators (Context Preserving, Worklist, Result-so-far; weird name IK).
- Operating on GRAPHS (Wasn't fun ... maybe it was :).
