# This is the first course in the core programming part.
<sub>It took me almost 1 month to finish it, but It could take less time if I took it on vacation, not during final exams :)</sub>
## What I gained (Mindset):
- Understood the concepts I already know much much better.
- Learned how to organize the project by following a pattern (recipe).
- How to understand the problem you are trying to solve.
- How to start thinking about the problem as chunks.
- How to perform <strong>Domain Analysis</strong>.
- How to turn these analyses into a real project by:
  - Design well-designed <strong>Data Definitions</strong>.
  - Design functions to operate on these data definitions.
- How to split a task into a suitable amount of sub-tasks.
- Writing code is the very last step.
  
## What I gained (Technical):
- Got exposed to the fundamentals in a whole different environment (racket lang), which pushed me to understand them in a deeper way.
- More hands-on experience working with <strong>Recursion (self-reference)</strong>.
- Learned about <strong>Function Composition</strong>.
- Had so much fun with racket-lang, which made me appreciate langs like Java and Python :)
- Made the final Project (space invader) and applied almost all the skills I learned in one project, and you can download it and try it btw (but you will need to download DrRacket).

### Conclusion
- It was a great experience, totally different from taking a web dev course or something similar.
- Almost every part of it is really challenging and pushed me to think 5 times before writing one line of code.
- Gave me a new way of thinking about problems and designing a program.
- Expanded my horizons and the spectrum of what is CS in my mind.
