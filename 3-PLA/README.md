# It's finally finished after A LOT of studying math, and fixing ml code bugs :)

## What I gained:

I won't separate technical from mindset changes, a lot of people reviewed this course way better than what I can say, but I want to talk from a different perspective; I had no math background when I started this course, I had to stop in week2 to get some foundational math concepts (which didn't make much difference but they helped me love math), then I went back to continue the course which was a great journey, the instructor is one of the best! he knew exactly how to explain the complex concepts in a somehow easier terms until students have the capacity to get the complete truth, the material itself is something different. I actually loved functional programming more than what I could ever imagine, because this course helped me understand it firstly, then fall in love with it. Super excited to the next part and I have to stop here because I have A LOT to say. :)
